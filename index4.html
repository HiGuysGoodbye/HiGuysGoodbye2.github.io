        Quick <em>hummus</em> recipe This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. 
        It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years. 
        Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. 
        It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.

        <p> <em>Hummus</em>, creamy dip that hails from the Middle East, has a 
            reputation as a clean, healthy food. It deserves it.
        
            All the main ingredients are super foods in their own right. It's got chickpeas, 
            sesame paste (tahini), garlic, and <strong>olive oil in most traditional versions.</strong></p>

                It's convenient to buy a plastic container of hummus <img src="Images/hummus-with-pita-89011767-5a764d1f3128340036adb965.jpg" alt="hum" width="100" height="75"> at the store, 
                but youâ€™d be surprised at how easy it is to whip up at home. 
                You'll save a few bucks and know exactly what's in your hummus.
